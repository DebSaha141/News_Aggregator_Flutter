          "A major international event of pickleball, one of the fastest-growing games in the world, started in New Delhi on Thursday.\nThe Pickleball World Rankings (PWR), dubbed the PWR DUPR India Masters, features over 700 players from various countries and will be held at the RK Khanna Tennis Stadium between October 24 and 27.\nInternational players, including Dustin Boyer and Phuc Huynh from the United States, Mitch Hargreaves and Emilia Schmidt from Australia, Roos Van Reek (Netherlands) and Pei Chuan Kao (Chinese Taipei) are participating.\nLeading Indian pickleball players Armaan Bhatia and Aditya Ruhela will also compete in the event, which offers a prize pool of USD 50,000.\nA paddle bat and playing ball. File photo: AFP\n\"The PWR DUPR India Masters is a landmark event that highlights the emergence of pickleball as a beloved sport in India for all ages,\" said Pranav Kohli, CEO of PWR. \"This event not only gives professionals a platform to compete and earn ranking points but also plays a key role in identifying and nurturing domestic talent, fostering a new generation of players and fans,\" he said.\nThe PWR is a unified global ranking system that enables players to earn points by participating in the PWR World Tour to improve their rankings and become eligible for the PWR World Series.\nPeople play pickleball on the courts of CityPickle at Central Park's Wollman Rink on August 27, 2024 in New York City. File photo: AFP/ Spencer Platt\nWhat is pickleball?\nPickleball is similar to tennis, badminton, and table tennis. It is played on a court smaller than that used for tennis. It is played in both doubles and singles formats, and the players use short-handled paddles and a perforated hollow plastic ball.\nThe scoring system is somewhat similar to table tennis, where each player or team that gets to 11 points with a two-point difference wins a set. The serves are made underhand.\nPickleball can be compared to Padel as both games are played worldwide, both at the amateur and professional levels.

      "summary":
          "Lightspeed-backed artificial intelligence (AI) startup Sarvam AI launched its Large Language Model (LLM), Sarvam 1, on October 24.\nThe startup claims it is India's first homegrown multilingual LLM, trained from scratch on domestic AI infrastructure in 10 Indian languages and English, according to a post on X (formerly Twitter).\nSarvam 1 supports English along with 10 major Indian languages: Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, and Telugu. The LLM is trained on Nvidia's H100 Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and utilizes a two-billion-parameter language model.\nSarvam AI also uses a host of services and products of Nvidia, such as its microservice, conversational AI, LLM software, and inference server to optimise and deploy conversational AI agents with sub-second latency.\nApart from Nvidia, the LLM used Yotta's data centres for compute infrastructure and AI4Bharat's open-source technology and language resources.\n'This combination of high performance and computational efficiency makes Sarvam-1 particularly well-suited for practical applications, including deployment on edge devices,' the AI company wrote in a blog post.\nIn December 2023, the AI startup launched Open Hathi, India's first Hindi LLM. The model was built on Meta AI's Llama2-7B architecture, with 48,000 token extensions. On the other hand, Sarvam is developed using a training corpus of 2 trillion tokens.\nThe LLM has two trillion tokens of synthetic Indic data due to its efficient tokenizer, with the custom data pipeline capable of generating high-quality and diverse text, while maintaining factual accuracy. Sarvam said the latest from its stable matches or beats much larger models like Llama 3.1 8B, apart from being four to six times faster during inference.\nIn AI, inference refers to the process by which a trained model makes predictions or draws conclusions from new data based on the patterns it learned during training.\nSarvam-2T, the startups' pretraining corpus, supports two times longer documents, three times higher quality, and eight times more scientific content than existing Indic datasets. Sarvam-2T stores around 2 trillion Indic tokens in total.\nThe data is almost evenly split between the 10 supported languages, with the exception of Hindi, which comprises about 20 percent of the data.\nAlso read: India aims to be the AI use-case capital of the world, says Nandan Nilekani",

          "Humanity is 'paying a terrible price' for inaction on\nglobal warming\n, with time running out to correct the course and avoid climate disaster, UN Secretary General\nAntonio Guterres\nsaid Thursday.\nA new report by the\nUN Environment Programme\n(UNEP) says the next decade is critical in the fight against\nclimate change\nor any hope of limiting global warming to 1.5C will be lost.\nThe current pace of climate action would result in a catastrophic 3.1 degrees Celsius of warming this century, UNEP said in its latest Emissions Gap report.\nAnd even if all existing pledges to cut emissions were enacted as promised, global temperatures would soar 2.6C above pre-industrial levels -- a still devastating scenario for humanity.\n\"Either leaders bridge the emissions gap, or we plunge headlong into climate disaster, with the poorest and most vulnerable suffering the most,\" said Guterres.\n\"Around the world, people are paying a terrible price.\"\nThe call to action follows a streak of destructive and deadly extreme weather and comes in a year expected to be the hottest in recorded history.\nThe world's poorest have been particularly hard hit, with typhoons and heatwaves in Asia and the Caribbean, floods in Africa, and droughts and wildfires in Latin America.\nNations meeting at the\nCOP29\nclimate summit next month in Azerbaijan hope to agree on increasing finance for the developing world to cope with climate change.\n- 'Out of time' -\nUNEP's latest projections blow well past 1.5C, which nations agreed in Paris in 2015 was the safest bet to minimise the worst consequences of a warming planet.\nThat goal was \"still technically possible\", UNEP said -- but only with enormous reductions by 2035 in heat-trapping gases caused primarily by burning fossil fuels.\nRather than declining, emissions are still rising, hitting a new record high last year.\nGuterres said the world was \"playing with fire\".\n\"But there can be no more playing for time. We're out of time,\" he said.\nKeeping 1.5C on track would require a collective effort \"only ever seen ever seen following a global conflict\", UNEP said.\nWithout pulling together \"on a scale and pace never seen before... the 1.5C goal will soon be dead,\" said UNEP executive director Inger Andersen.\nTo have a hope of meeting 1.5C, emissions must be slashed 42 percent by 2030 and 57 percent by 2035, UNEP said.\nThe existing suite of climate commitments -- including those contingent on outside financial help -- would only cut expected 2030 emissions by 10 percent if implemented as promised.\n\"These reports are an historical litany of negligence from the world's leaders to tackle the climate crisis with the urgency it demands, but it's not too late to take corrective action,\" said Tracy Carty from Greenpeace International.\n- 'Bridge the gap' -\nUNEP said advances in solar and wind, two proven and cost-effective technologies, could deliver a steep fall in emissions but investment in such carbon-cutting solutions needed to rise six-fold to meet 1.5C.\nGuterres said wealthy nations of the G20 must lead the way.\n\"Either leaders bridge the emissions gap, or we plunge headlong into climate disaster,\" he said.\nThe world's 20 largest economies were responsible for nearly 80 percent of global emissions in 2023. The bottom 47 countries accounted for three percent.\nThe United States was historically the biggest polluter, accounting for 20 percent of global emissions since 1850, when the burning of fossil fuels for energy began in earnest.\nThe European Union and China accounted for 12 percent each, UNEP said.\nA breach of 1.5C is increasingly being seen as inevitable by scientists and policymakers.\nBut a recent study found that even temporarily exceeding 1.5C before bringing warming back down -- a scenario known as an 'overshoot' -- could cause irreversible consequences for the planet.",

          "Recalled Indian High Commissioner to Canada,\nSanjay Verma\non Thursday shared a terrifying moment when Khalistani attacked him with a sword in Alberta while he was along with his wife.\nIn an exclusive interview with ANI, Verma said that the Khalistani 'goons' came very close to bodily harm him adding that they were not carrying the 'kirpan', a religious object, but a sword that could potentially harm him.\n\"Yes, a couple of times they came very close to bodily harm us...They were carrying a sword, it was not a Kirpan...When I was in Alberta a sword came around 2-2.5 inches close to my body...,\" said Verma.\nThe recalled Indian envoy also said that he was accompanied by his wife. \"When I was in Alberta my wife was also with me...,\" he said.\nVerma said the Khalistanis surrounded the exit gate and attacked him. \"I was in a city in Alberta. And there the Indians had a dinner party which also had cultural programs, where it was expected that I would meet the Indians. And that was a business event. So many businessmen from Canada were there. And the main thing was how we could advance the business relationship, what new things we could bring, what new sectors we could bring. This was in a convention hall. Outside, around 150 people were there who were doing bad things in the name of Khalistan. And they surrounded the entrance from which I had to go. When I entered, there were RCMP and local police. Alberta is our good friend. Local police were present there. But maybe they didn't think that they would do such a bad thing. My wife was accompanying me. When I was passing, there was a sword. And it was not a kirpan. They may not know the difference between sword and a kirpan. But we Indians who have seen Sikhism, who are so patriotic, where we have seen them, by the grace of Wahe Guru, we know the difference between a sword and a kirpan. So this was a sword, which came about 2 to 2.5 inches away from my body,\" he said.\nArtificial Intelligence(AI)\nMaster in Python Language Quickly Using the ChatGPT Open AI\nBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and Developer\nView Program\nLeadership\nBusiness Storytelling Masterclass\nBy - Ameen Haque, Founder of Storywallahs\nView Program\nHR\nHuman Potential and the Future of Employment\nBy - Lynda Gratton, Prof. at London Business School, Speaker, Author, Global Thought Leader\nView Program\nMarketing\nModern Marketing Masterclass by Seth Godin\nBy - Seth Godin, Former dot com Business Executive and Best Selling Author\nView Program\nArtificial Intelligence(AI)\nAI and Analytics based Business Strategy\nBy - Tanusree De, Managing Director- Accenture Technology Lead, Trustworthy AI Center of Excellence: ATCI\nView Program\nArtificial Intelligence(AI)\nBasics of Generative AI : Unveiling Tomorrow's Innovations\nBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and Developer\nView Program\nOffice Productivity\nZero to Hero in Microsoft Excel: Complete Excel guide 2024\nBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and Developer\nView Program\nFinance\nA2Z Of Money\nBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdge\nView Program\nWeb Development\nMaster RESTful APIs with Python and Django REST Framework: Web API Development\nBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and Developer\nView Program\nMarketing\nFuture of Marketing & Branding Masterclass\nBy - Dr. David Aaker, Professor Emeritus at the Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley, Author | Speaker | Thought Leader | Branding Consultant\nView Program\nArtificial Intelligence(AI)\nMastering C++ Fundamentals with Generative AI: A Hands-On\nBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and Developer\nView Program\nWeb Development\nAdvanced Java Mastery: Object-Oriented Programming Techniques\nBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and Developer\nView Program\nWeb Development\nJavaScript Essentials: Unlock AI-Driven Insights with ChatGPT\nBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and Developer\nView Program\nOffice Productivity\nMastering Microsoft Office: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 365\nBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and Developer\nView Program\nMarketing\nDigital Marketing Masterclass by Neil Patel\nBy - Neil Patel, Co-Founder and Author at Neil Patel Digital Digital Marketing Guru\nView Program\nWeb Development\nIntermediate C++ Skills: Master Pointers, Structures and File Stream\nBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and Developer\nView Program\nData Science\nSQL for Data Science along with Data Analytics and Data Visualization\nBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and Developer\nView Program\nWeb Development\nJava 21 Essentials for Beginners: Build Strong Programming Foundations\nBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and Developer\nView Program\nAstrology\nVastu Shastra Course\nBy - Sachenkumar Rai, Vastu Shashtri\nView Program\nYou Might Also Like:\nHard-line Khalistanis in Canada doing human trafficking, gun running, alleges ex-Indian envoy\nVerma said that the local police held an interrogation later, and he was not given the details about the same.\n\"The local police got into action immediately and pushed them back. They also held an interrogation. I was not informed about the final results. We also informed the Global Affairs of Canada about the incident. They also believed that this is not right. And we also tried to explain to them that there is a difference between a sword and a kirpan. There is a difference between a spear and a kirpan. And this is not a religious belonging that they carry,\" he said.\nVerma said that as per Canada's own assessment was that the Indian diplomats could be harmed. So, they were given protection from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\n\"Let's look at their own assessment. The very fact that I was given a close protection detail of RCMP and my two consul generals were given the same, also shows that their assessment was that we could be bodily harmed. I'm talking about their assessment,\" he said.\nVerma added, \"So there are a couple of such incidents. But my main purpose is that the relationship between the two countries should be restored.\"\nVerma said that\nKhalistani goons\nthreaten peace-loving Indo-Canadians and vandalise their place of worship.\n\"Indo-Canadians are being threatened by the hooligans who are Khalistani goons. They are Khalistani terrorists and extremists. They go in our society of peace-loving Indo-Canadians and threaten them. They go to our places of worship and vandalize them. So if that is being tolerated by the system, the present system in particular, then how can you assure them for normalcy? So probably someone will have to sit down, look at it. Why is it unfair for those Indo-Canadians who believe in a certain religion, in a certain faith, and want to live peacefully and contribute to the growth and development of Canada, being threatened by a handful of goons. That has to be looked at,\" he said.\nVerma was recalled from Canada after the country said he was a person of interest in the\nHardeep Singh Nijjar\nmurder case; however, he denied all charges levelled against him by Ottawa in connection with the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.\nThe ties between India and Canada soured after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged in the Canadian Parliament last year that he has \"credible allegations\" of India's hand in the killing of Nijjar.\nIndia has denied all the allegations, calling them \"absurd\" and \"motivated\" and has accused Canada of giving space to extremist and anti-India elements in their country.\nNijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India's National Investigation Agency in 2020, was shot and killed outside a Gurdwara in Surrey in June last year.\nAmid worsening ties between the two countries, India had earlier this month \"strongly\" rejected a diplomatic communication from Canada suggesting that the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats were \"persons of interest\" in an investigation and termed it as \"preposterous imputations\" and part of the political agenda of the Justin Trudeau government.\nIn a hard-hitting statement, India said Prime Minister Trudeau's hostility to India has long been in evidence and his government has consciously provided space to violent extremists and terrorists \"to harass, threaten and intimidate Indian diplomats and community leaders in Canada\".\nIndia had had expelled six Canadian diplomats hours after it summoned Canada's Charge d'Affaires Stewart Wheeler and conveyed that the \"baseless targeting\" of the Indian High Commissioner and other diplomats and officials in Canada was completely unacceptable.
